# NetBSDAutoconf
Tools for make netbsd more user-friendly and easy

# Why is this necessary?
This project includes autopkgsrc building&updates (in WIP repository also), rc.conf tools and integtated with my other project [NBNetworkManager](https://github.com/Nam4ik/NBNetworkManager).

NetBSD is a complex but extremely powerful and minimalistic system that is difficult to master. It was quite difficult the first time, so I want everyone to be able to try NetBSD without any problems with the Internet.
For this purpose, a number of packages have been created for easier use and installation. (Work in progress)
